                <p>
                    I usually don't like sharing about myself, but I do enjoy programming.
                    I've also volunteered at a local school and church, and helped to organize a rally. 
                    I had attended Corbett School District since 5th grade, before that going to a local elementary school.
                    As of writing this, I'm developing my own game in my free time.
                    Here's a bulleted list:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> list element 1 </li>
                        <li> list element 2 </li>
                        <li> list element 3 </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p> and here's an ordered list: </p>

                        <li> list element 1 </li>
